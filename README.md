# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

In this week's assignment, we had to create a work day schedule for regular business hours. We were provided with some of the code mostly, HTML and CSS, and most of the work completed had to be done on JavaScript. The time slots change their color based on what is the local time of the user versus the time on the time block. Grey for past, red for present and green for future. Once user inputs data and clicks the button to save, it will store the data in local storage. Upon refreshing the page, the data will still remain on the time block.

## What was done?

Most of the assigment was coded via JavaScript, mostly jQuery and dayjs. A condition code had to be created to compare between user's local time versus time block in a way that the blocks change their colors depending on time. Localstorage was also used to grab the data as written by user and stored locally, and then using getItem so the data appears on the page.
